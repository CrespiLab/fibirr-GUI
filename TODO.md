# To-Do List

## To Do
### Soon
- [ ] Add option for exponential fitting of kinetic trace
- [ ] Add plotting options: x-axis and y-axis limits; etc.
- [ ] Generate configurations file with settings used per measurement
- [ ] Combine saved files (at least Intensity spectra) into one file
  - [ ] Compress into binary file
- [ ] Add logo (goat)

### Later
- [ ] Add Acquisition Mode: IrrKin followed by Kin
- [ ] Add SpectraViewer tab
- [ ] Add module for power measurement of LEDs

## In Progress :)
- [ ] Add back-up save feature for recorded spectra
- [ ] Add (auto-)save options
  - [x] Option: folder for auto-saving of spectra
  - [ ] Option: choose name of savefile

- [ ] Add status box for messages, errors, warnings, etc.
- [ ] Add pop-up message when measurement is done

## Completed ✓
- [x] Add and fix Measurement Statistics: time passed; nr of measurements done; etc.
- [x] Log timestamps during Kin and IrrKin measurements
- [x] Make sure not to overwrite Single spectra
- [x] Add feature to load Reference (and Dark)
- [x] Add Acquisition Mode: Continuous

- [x] Add plot: live trace of Abs at chosen wavelength
- [x] Add plot: latest recorded spectra during (irradiation) kinetics measurement (load from disk)
